# Quick Start

- Check if this repo's config supports your laptop, see *[Compatibility](#compatibility)*.
- Download [Tongfang Hackintosh Utility](https://github.com/kirainmoe/tongfang-hackintosh-utility/releases) and customize the OpenCore config for your model. 
  - You will have `Tongfang_EFI` folder on your `~/Desktop`.
  - **Do not download the full repository using "Download Zip" button.**

- Download a latest version of macOS from somewhere. 
  - If you are using Windows, the most convenient way is to use [GibMacOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS), click [here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/winblows-install.html#downloading-macos) to learn more.
  - If you already has a modified DMG file, use [BalenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher) to make a installer flash.
- Part your disk that you are going to install macOS.
  - You should have a GUID partition table and a 200M+ ESP (EFI System Partition). 
- Copy `Tongfang_EFI/BOOT` and `Tongfang_EFI/OC` folder you obtained in the first step to the `EFI` folder of the ESP of your flash disk.
  - After this progress you will have `EFI/BOOT` and `EFI/OC` on your ESP.
- Disable `Secure Boot`, `Launch CSM` and change to `UEFI Mode` in BIOS.
- Boot OpenCore from USB flash and install macOS.
- After boot into the system, use [Tongfang Hackintosh Utility](https://github.com/kirainmoe/tongfang-hackintosh-utility/releases) (for macOS) to improve the experience.
- Enjoy your hackintosh build!

### Barebones

Currently, this config is known to be compatible with all 8th / 9th generation Tongfang barebones (although some barebones models are not listed in the following table). For example:

| Barebone | Platform Generation |
|----------|---------------------|
| GK5CN5X, GK5CN6X | 8th |
| GK5CN5Z, GK5CN6Z | 8th |
| GK7CN6S, GK7CN5S | 8th |
| GI5CN54, GJ5CN64 (PS/2 Touchpad) | 8th |
| GK5CP6Z, GK5CP5Z | 9th |
| GK5CP6X, GK5CP5X | 9th |
| GK7CP6R, GK7CP0R | 9th |
| GK5CP5V, GK5CP6V | 9th |

If you have 8th gen platform laptops with I2C touchpad but the barebone model is not in the list, try one of GK5CN6X, GK5CN6Z (GTX 1060) or GK5CN5X, GK5CN5Z (GTX 1050Ti).

If you have 8th gen platform laptops with PS/2 touchpad but the barebone model is not in the list, try one of GJ5CN64 (GTX 1060) or GI5CN54 (GTX 1050Ti).

If you have 9th gen platform laptops but the barebone model is not in the list, try one of *GK7CP6R, GK5CP6X, GK5CP5X, GK5CP6V, GK5CP5V, GK5CP6Z, GK5CP5Z...*

**Please use [Tongfang Hackintosh Utility](https://github.com/kirainmoe/project-starbeat/releases) to download / customize the OC config.**


### Models

> Notes: I was not sure that some models can work perfectly with this config. The models listed in the following table are those would be theoretically supported gussing by their barebone model.  
**If you have any Tongfang laptop and successfully installed with one of the following configs, please open an issue and tell me.**

#### Tips

| Barebone | Models Theoretically Supported | Generation
|-----|------|-----|
| GK5CN5X <br> GK5CN6X <br> GK5CN6Z <br> GK5CN5Z <br>GK7CN6S<br>GK7CN5S | Mechrevo Z2 (Air) <br>XMG Neo 15<br>Overpowered Gaming Laptop 15<br>MACHENIKE F117-B1/2 <br> Monster Abra A7 v10.1 <br> Monster Abra A5 v13.4 <br>Overpowered 17+ laptop | 8th Generation |
